# Machine_And_Deep_Learning

:sparkles::fireworks::tada: Important points about this Repository!!!!! :tada::fireworks::sparkles: 

- It contains projects which uses Machine and Deep Learning with proper explanation.
- For Explanation of imported libraries, I suggest all to refer the earliest projects in this repository as they have clear cut of the libraries. In latest and upcoming I explain the technology I am using and I also explain the project, but I do not foucs on the libraries imported there.

- It is tool which provide the easiest interface to work with Python or R programming Language.
- It provides complete absraction from the backend processes regarding code execution and libraries included.
- It act as a portable agent which allows to create and share live code.
- It is considered to be best alternative to any of the IDE.
- I prefer it over any other software for smooth workflow.
